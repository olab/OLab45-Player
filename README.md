## Welcome to OLab4
OLab4 is an open source web-based educational research platform that supports the creation and publication of virtual scenarios. Much of its original structure is based on OpenLabyrinth v3, a platform that was originally designed to support virtual patients but evolved into so much more.

The OLab 4.5 Player has been completely rewritten from the ground up, using .NET Framework v6

OLab4 remains a standalone project. You do not have to buy components or tools in order to use or install OLab4. OLab4 will remain free and open-source.
